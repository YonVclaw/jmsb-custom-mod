// ONE MAN, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE FACTION.
//
// THE 1ST JMSB IS A PLAYER FACTION. Almost everything about a player is set in the
// mission - the slot's loadout, its gear, its vehicle - so a config roster of
// thirty specialists would be thirty classes nobody ever spawns. One scout is
// what a slot needs in order to exist; the mission does the rest.
//
// THE LOADOUT IS AN ARRAY, NOT A PILE OF weapons[] LINES. That is the
// authoring loop the faction builder handoff describes (section 9): an arsenal
// export becomes a getUnitLoadout array and a spawn hook applies it. The
// weapons[]/linkedItems[] underneath are what the EDITOR reads for its preview
// and what the man carries before the hook runs - they mirror the array rather
// than competing with it.
//
// THE ARRAY IS THE USER'S OWN EXPORT (2026-10-08, "this is the default load
// out"): SF fatigues in OCP, the Ferro Bison carrier in multicam with a PRC-152
// and two spare magazines in it, the OCP boonie, a VP9. The vest and the pistol
// come from MIG and SPS, which is why config.cpp requires both.

// CBA'S EXTENDED EVENT HANDLERS, DECLARED SO THEY CAN BE KEPT.
// A class that writes its own EventHandlers REPLACES the parent's, and the
// parent's is where CBA put its XEH hooks - so every one of these men was
// reported as "does not support Extended Event Handlers" and dropped out of
// everything built on them. Inheriting the class below inside our own
// EventHandlers keeps both: CBA's hooks and our loadout init.
