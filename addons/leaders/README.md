# Leaders

`jmfsb_leaders`

The asymmetric chain: **three leaders, and only a player's hand takes one off
the board.** A leader lost to crossfire, a mine or ALiVE's own war is quietly
replaced - a successor stands up in a new safe house, and the corpse stops
carrying the phone. A kill nobody earned must not end a hunt nobody got to
run.

They live in safe houses - enterable buildings in settlement clusters inside
the asymmetric commander's TAOR - and rotate between them. Intel points at the
**safe house, never the man**, and once he is moving it points at the house he
is going to, so the chain is followed rather than solved. A house may be
watched: walk in and 3-4 mortar rounds arrive. (IEDs stay ALiVE's.)

**Take one alive** and deliver him to a `jmfsb_prison*` marker and he gives up
another leader's position exactly - the only moment the chain hands over a
point instead of a circle, and it costs a live prisoner rather than a hack.

Killing or capturing one cuts the asymmetric pool by the slider, and the state
survives a restart.
