# UAS

`jmfsb_uas`

Patrol drones and the supply that limits them.

**One module is one patrol.** Place a *JMSB - Drone Patrol* module in Eden or in
Zeus, resize it, and it says everything about that patrol: whose drones, how
many, which airframe, and whether a drone that sees somebody calls artillery on
them. Several patrols, several modules. In jmfsb this addon flew drones over each
ALiVE commander's own objectives with one shared per-side ceiling; a number on
the module you placed is a better answer than a ceiling shared across the map,
so the module is the unit of work here.

**ALiVE objectives can become zones too, and it is off by default.** Turn on
*Patrol ALiVE objectives* under 1st Joint Multi-Functional Strike Battalion / Drones and
`FUNC(zonesFromAlive)` takes a share of each commander's objectives - capped -
and appends them to `GVAR(zones)` as ordinary entries, once, when the campaign
comes up. Every function here treats them exactly like a drawn module, because
they are the same shape. They ADD to the modules you placed rather than
replacing them, and they never call for artillery: that is a decision about one
piece of ground, so it lives on a module.

**Supply caches** are real crates inside those zones, unmarked and unhinted -
finding them is what the intel economy is for. Kill one and that side's airframe
ceiling drops for a random window: the sky visibly thins, then comes back.
Outages extend rather than stack, so supply raids are raids and not a win button.

**Nobody near, nothing flying.** A patrol exists to be met. One orbiting ground
four kilometres from the nearest player is an airframe, a crew and an AI pilot
simulated for an audience of nobody, so a zone with nobody inside 3.2 km is not
patrolled and the patrols whose audience has left are retired. An empty map costs
nothing.

**A patrol never grows past its own number**, and the supply outage only ever
reduces it: while a side's cache is down every one of its patrols thins to one
airframe, then fills again when the window closes. Outage windows and the cache
count are CBA settings under *1st Joint Multi-Functional Strike Battalion > Drones*; everything else about a
patrol is on its own module.

A drone that actually sees a player - `knowsAbout`, not proximity - reports it
down the same path a failed hack takes.
