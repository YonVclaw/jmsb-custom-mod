# QRF

`jmfsb_qrf`

Answers the players taking ground. **No countdown and no warning** - the reply
is the consequence, not a timer.

Capture is the held condition: players of one side inside, nobody hostile,
for the hold time. Any break resets it. Watched over every AI commander's
objectives and any `jmfsb_qrf*` marker - markers work with no ALiVE at all.

The commander that owns the fight answers in three waves: **artillery** asked
of its own guns and scaled to the ground taken (an asymmetric commander has
no gun line, so 3-4 mortar rounds about half the time), a **drone** out of its
cache-limited ceiling, and **squads** spawned 3-6 km out, profiled, and walked
in so they arrive rather than appear.

### JMSB - QRF

`jmfsb_moduleQRF`, category jmfsb_modules

Placing this module turns on qrf. Without it, the system is off.<br>Hold Time (sec) - How long players must hold an objective, uncontested, before it counts as taken Players Needed - How many players inside before a hold counts at all Squads Min - Fewest squads the third wave sends Squads Max - Most squads Asymmetric Mortar Chance (%) - An asymmetric commander answers with a few mortar rounds or with nothing - never a full barrage Cooldown (sec) - Retaking the same objective inside this window brings no second QRF
