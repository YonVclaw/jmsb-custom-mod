#include "script_component.hpp"
/*
 * Author: YonV
 * Names and colours the main menu quick connect buttons, points them at
 * whatever the settings say, and removes the ones with nowhere to go.
 *
 * A SCRIPT, NOT A PREP'D FUNCTION, and deliberately - the same shape as
 * XEH_multiplayerDisplay beside it. The config handler runs inside
 * "with uiNamespace do", so a FUNC() there is a variable lookup in a namespace
 * the functions are not in; COMPILE_SCRIPT compiles this file by path and asks
 * nothing of any namespace. Nothing in here calls out to a FUNC for the same
 * reason.
 *
 * WHAT THIS REPLACED. Three buttons in RscDisplayMain.hpp, each with its name in
 * a text property and its whole connection in a config string:
 *
 *     onButtonClick = "connectToServer ['', 2302, ''];";
 *
 * Moving a server meant editing the config and shipping a PBO, and a unit
 * running its own servers could not use the menu without forking the mod.
 *
 * NO ADDRESS MEANS NO BUTTON. An empty address is not a broken setting, it is a
 * slot pointed at nothing - a unit with one server, or ours before the others
 * are up. A button that connects nowhere is worse than no button, so it is
 * hidden rather than left to fail on click. A port of 0 does the same.
 *
 * READ FROM THE PROFILE. See FUNC(cacheServers): preInit has not run when this
 * display is drawn, so the CBA settings do not exist yet and profileNamespace is
 * where the values are. The fallback below is the shipped three, so a player who
 * has never reached a mission still gets working buttons on first launch.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: Main menu display <DISPLAY>
 *
 * Return Value:
 * None
 *
 * Public: No
