Everything under **Options > Addon Options**. `Default` is the value the addon
ships with, which a mission or the forced list below can override.

## Admin Panel (`adminpanel`)

| Setting | Type | Category | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Enable admin console | CHECKBOX | 1st Joint Multi-Functional Strike Battalion > Admin Console | `true` | Registers the admin console keybinds and the #jmfsb admin commands. Off leaves the addon loaded and inert - it does not grant or revoke anybody's admi |
| JMSB admins may open it | CHECKBOX | 1st Joint Multi-Functional Strike Battalion > Admin Console | `true` | Lets anyone carrying jmfsb's own admin flag open the console, as well as the uids in the mission's list. Off means the mission's list is the only way  |

## Ai Disembark (`ai_disembark`)

| Setting | Type | Category | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Force reload on disembarking AI | CHECKBOX | 1st Joint Multi-Functional Strike Battalion > 1st Joint Multi-Functional Strike Battalion - AI Disembark | `false` | Forces AI to play reload animation after disembarking from vehicle. Prevents instant shooting after disembark. |
| Stay in immobile vehicle chance | SLIDER | 1st Joint Multi-Functional Strike Battalion > 1st Joint Multi-Functional Strike Battalion - AI Disembark | `[0, 1, 0, 0, true]` | Chance that AI will be told to stay in immobilized vehicles, applied on vehicle init. |

## AntiShip (`antiship`)

| Setting | Type | Category | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Seconds between launches | SLIDER | 1st Joint Multi-Functional Strike Battalion > Anti-Ship | `[60, 3600, AS_INTERVAL_DEF, 0]` | How long a battery waits between shots. The clock resets whether or not it found a hull, so a battery does not fire the instant a ship appears - that  |
| Search range (m) | SLIDER | 1st Joint Multi-Functional Strike Battalion > Anti-Ship | `[1000, 30000, AS_SEARCH_DEF, 0]` | How far a battery looks for a hull. With a radar on the net it sees what the radar sees; with none it looks for itself, which is what this bounds. |
| Target classes | EDITBOX | 1st Joint Multi-Functional Strike Battalion > Anti-Ship | `AS_TARGETS_DEF` | Comma-separated. What counts as a hull worth a missile. |
| Missile speed (m/s) | SLIDER | 1st Joint Multi-Functional Strike Battalion > Anti-Ship | `[200, 1500, AS_SPEED_DEF, 0]` | Cruise speed on the run in. Fast enough that it has to be met head-on rather than chased, which is the whole shape of defending against one. |
| Cruise altitude (m) | SLIDER | 1st Joint Multi-Functional Strike Battalion > Anti-Ship | `[5, 500, AS_CRUISE_ALT_DEF, 0]` | Height above the sea on the run in. Low is what makes it hard to see coming and hard to engage. |
| Terminal range (m) | SLIDER | 1st Joint Multi-Functional Strike Battalion > Anti-Ship | `[100, 5000, AS_TERMINAL_DEF, 0]` | Distance from the hull where it stops cruising and dives. |
| Interceptable | CHECKBOX | 1st Joint Multi-Functional Strike Battalion > Anti-Ship | `true` | The missile carries a decoy the defending side's AA and CIWS can engage. Off: nothing can lock it and it always arrives. |
| Debug | CHECKBOX | 1st Joint Multi-Functional Strike Battalion > Anti-Ship | `false` | Log every cycle to the RPT: what a battery looked for, what it found, what it fired and where the missile went. |

## APS (`aps`)

| Setting | Type | Category | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Active protection | CHECKBOX | 1st Joint Multi-Functional Strike Battalion > APS | `true` | Master switch. On, vehicles get the protection their faction's tier allows and the HUD's APS tile is live. Off, nothing is registered and every vehicl |
| Max engagement angle | SLIDER | 1st Joint Multi-Functional Strike Battalion > APS | `[10, 90, 45, 0]` | Steepest approach the launchers can engage, degrees above the horizon. A top-attack missile diving steeper than this gets through - the counter to har |
| Max round size (hit) | SLIDER | 1st Joint Multi-Functional Strike Battalion > APS | `[200, 5000, 2000, 0]` | Rounds whose CfgAmmo hit value is above this are too big to stop - the launchers let them through. |
| Rearm range (m) | SLIDER | 1st Joint Multi-Functional Strike Battalion > APS | `[10, 200, 50, 0]` | A vehicle within this of an ammo truck or crate reloads its charges. Reloading the vehicle's own guns reloads them too. |
| Rearm check (s) | SLIDER | 1st Joint Multi-Functional Strike Battalion > APS | `[1, 60, 5, 0]` | How often a fitted vehicle looks for a rearm. |
| Default tier | LIST | 1st Joint Multi-Functional Strike Battalion > APS | `[[0, 1, 2, 3, 4], ["0 - irregular", "1 -` | The tier of a faction the mod does not know - a third-party mod's, usually. 0-1 nothing, 2 near-peer (basic hard kill on tanks and cannon IFVs), 3 pee |
| APS panel scope | LIST | 1st Joint Multi-Functional Strike Battalion > APS | `[[0, 1, 2], ["Own vehicle", "Group's veh` | Which fitted vehicles the map panel lists and lets you switch: only the one you are in, every vehicle your group is crewing, or every crewed vehicle o |
| Show APS panel | CHECKBOX | 1st Joint Multi-Functional Strike Battalion > Tacpad | `true` | The APS panel on the map screen: every fitted vehicle you are entitled to see, its charges and its emitter, and the HK HOLD / RF HOLD / BURST switches |
| Tier overrides | EDITBOX | 1st Joint Multi-Functional Strike Battalion > APS | `""` | faction:tier pairs, comma separated - 'jmfsb_AAF:3, OPF_F:4'. The module's own field adds to these. |
| RF engagement radius (m) | SLIDER | 1st Joint Multi-Functional Strike Battalion > APS | `[50, 500, 150, 0]` | The burst is a sphere this big. Guided munitions and drones inside it are hit. |
| RF close floor (m) | SLIDER | 1st Joint Multi-Functional Strike Battalion > APS | `[10, 200, 60, 0]` | Anything susceptible inside this fires the burst whatever it seems to be doing. Outside it, only a contact closing on the vehicle does - transit traff |
| RF closing speed (m/s) | SLIDER | 1st Joint Multi-Functional Strike Battalion > APS | `[0, 100, 15, 0]` | A contact counts as closing when its speed toward the vehicle is above this. |
| RF cooldown (s) | SLIDER | 1st Joint Multi-Functional Strike Battalion > APS | `[5, 300, 45, 0]` | The only resource the emitter has. A second attacker inside this window gets a free shot - the counter to the burst is to stagger, not mass. |
| RF jam radius (m) | SLIDER | 1st Joint Multi-Functional Strike Battalion > APS | `[10, 300, 75, 0]` | Every radio inside this is jammed by the burst, friend and foe. Kept smaller than the engagement radius - it is the near-field leakage off the emitter |
| RF jam - dismounts (s) | SLIDER | 1st Joint Multi-Functional Strike Battalion > APS | `[0, 30, 5, 1]` | How long a player on foot inside the jam radius loses the radio. |
| RF jam - own crew (s) | SLIDER | 1st Joint Multi-Functional Strike Battalion > APS | `[0, 30, 2, 1]` | The emitting vehicle's own crew are shielded by the hull: a shorter blackout, never none - it is their cue that the burst fired. |
| RF emitter damage limit | SLIDER | 1st Joint Multi-Functional Strike Battalion > APS | `[0.1, 1, 0.3, 2]` | Vehicle damage above this kills the emitter; so does a dead engine or the engine off. |
| RF: quadcopter / FPV | SLIDER | 1st Joint Multi-Functional Strike Battalion > APS | `[0, 1, 1, 2]` | Chance the burst drops a small drone in range. |
| RF: loitering munition | SLIDER | 1st Joint Multi-Functional Strike Battalion > APS | `[0, 1, 0.9, 2]` | Chance the burst drops a loitering munition - hardened, so a little less. |
| RF: guided missile | SLIDER | 1st Joint Multi-Functional Strike Battalion > APS | `[0, 1, 0.6, 2]` | Chance the burst strips guidance from a missile with a modern seeker - hardened seekers resist. |
| RF: IR / laser guided | SLIDER | 1st Joint Multi-Functional Strike Battalion > APS | `[0, 1, 0.8, 2]` | Chance the burst upsets an IR or laser seeker. This is the dazzler's job, done properly - the seeker loses the track rather than merely veering. |
